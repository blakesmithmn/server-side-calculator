# Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 24 hour Sprint_

Over the course of a weekend - we were tasked with creating a functional calculator (from scratch) that handled all of the calculations on the server we created.

## Description & Approach

As I continue to develop my personal workflow - I am trying to get into the habit of breaking down the complexity of the project at hand. One way I do this is by making a visual To-Do list / Flow Chart for me to follow. (like the one above)

Approaching the base mode of this assignment was easy enough - setting up input fields and connecting them to javascript functions that would be sent using POST requests to the server. From here - I made a function to handle the object transported server-side and stored results that could be retrieved by the users GET request. 

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Express 
- Body-Parser

## Installation
1. Clone this repository for your own access.
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
3. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/

## Usage
This web application is meant to function similar to a calculator in real life:
1. Press buttons to input your first number
2. Select a single math equation
3. Press buttons to input your second number
4. Press "="
5. See the answer on the calculator screen OR down below in the history section!
